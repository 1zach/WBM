                Weekly Ball Movement started as a humble podcast, a child podcast of the
                legendary "Outcast" podcast.  Eventually WBM grew to be an entire media empire
                including the foundational podcast, a magazine, a number of photographs, and this 
                website.  As time went on, more and more media interests came under the umbrella of
                WBM, including the Daegu Doggz.  WBM is proud to be one of the 10 greatest podcasts
                in DSL history.
